# Orbital-mechanics
### Installation
The whole project has been programmed in MATLAB file using the basic Toolbox. 

## Planetary Mission 
The mission to be designed had to study the evolution of a chosen orbit taking into account J2 effect (oblateness of the Earth) and Moon perturbations. All the results have been compared with an existing satellite which shares the relevant orbital elements for those perturbation given. In addition it has also been conducted an other comparison with the GMAT (NASA) orbital evolution which shows a satisfying total match.
### Integration
The integrator is a multi-step integrator which implement step-size control and order control (ode113).
